We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.

<div>
  <p> div hello</p>
</div>

<Button>Just click it</Button>

<CodeBlock>
  {`
const hello = ()=> {
  return console.log('hello')
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
